# Cloning & installing

Cloning is simple, using `git` (or the superior [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub/blob/master/README.md)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jabster28/node-backdoor
```

```bash
hub clone Jabster28/node-backdoor
```

This will download the project to your current directory with the name **node-backdoor**

After that, you need to install the dependencies using [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable):

```bash
yarn
```

And that's it! Now we can move on to generating payloads...
